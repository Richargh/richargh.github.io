= The Source for my Blog

This repository uses link:https://jekyllrb.com/[Jekyll] and the link:https://github.com/raghuveerdotnet/simply-jekyll[Simply Jekyll Theme].

The Asciidoc source is in the *docs* branch, while master only contains generated sources.

== Usage

. Install all gems: `bundle`
. Build the site and make it available on a local server: `bundle exec jekyll serve`
. Now browse to http://localhost:4000

== Prerequisites

=== Install Ruby

Since Mac comes bundled with an old ruby version I recommend using [Rubyenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv#installation)

. `brew install rbenv`
. Close and reopen terminal in this repo
. `which ruby` should now point to _~/.rbenv/shims/ruby_
. `ruby -v` should now be 2.6.3 for this directory

== Maintenance

* Update link:.ruby-version[]
* Update bundler: `bundle update --bundler`
* Update all gems: `bundle update`
