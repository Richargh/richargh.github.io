== Sandboxes

Sandboxes are small code playgrounds where I play around with various tech.
I usually publish them to link:https://github.com/search?q=owner%3ARichargh%20-sandbox&type=repositories[github with the `-sandbox` postfix].
They are not thoroughly documented but still very helpful as examples.
