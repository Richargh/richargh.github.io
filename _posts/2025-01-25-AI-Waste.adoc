Generative AI is a waste.
It's a waste of our time, our CO2 and our sanity.
Tom Fishburne perfectly summarises why in his web comic:

Can't we just communicate short and to the point?
All the stuff in the middle is waste.
It was waste before GenAI, it is worse with GenAi.

There are good use cases for AI.
Optimising the communication of people though, let's do that ourselves.
We gain nothing but waste if we keep it as is and "make it easier" with AI.
