Ever since Java switched to its six-month release cadence (link:https://openjdk.org/jeps/322[Time-Based Release Versioning]) it's become a bit harder to keep up with the features they've implemented.
//, especially the language updates that make it possible to write ever more concise Java code. See effective/concise Java for code examples that show how to write concise code
The following list tracks the stable (not incubating or in preview) feature changes I deemed most noteworthy. A *+* marks an added feature, a *-* marks a removed feature.
