Ever since Java switched to its six-month release cadence (link:https://openjdk.org/jeps/322[Time-Based Release Versioning]) it has become a bit harder to keep up with the features they have implemented.
//, especially the language updates that make it possible to write ever more concise Java code. See effective/concise Java for code examples that show how to write concise code
The following list tracks the stable (not incubating or in preview) feature changes I deemed most noteworthy.
The releases that Oracle will provide Long-Term Support (LTS) for are marked as such, based on the plan that link:https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/java-se-support-roadmap.html[Oracle publishes].

The list is ongoing and will be updated with every new Java release.
A *+* marks an added feature, a *-* marks a removed feature.

* 25 (expected September 2025) *LTS* until September 2030
* ...
* link:https://openjdk.org/projects/jdk/23/[23] (expected September 2024)
** _Preliminary opinion_, since JDK rampdown and feature set freeze won't happen before June.
*** Could this be the release that finally delivers link:https://openjdk.org/jeps/401[Primitive Classes Preview] and link:https://openjdk.org/jeps/8277163[Value Objects Preview]? We are likely to get record _withers_, also called link:https://openjdk.org/jeps/468[Derived Record creation (Preview)] which makes working with records so much nicer. It might also finalize scoped values and structured concurrency, important pieces of the virtual thread puzzle. And we'll probably get String templates finalized. Awesome stuff.

** +link:https://openjdk.org/jeps/454[Foreign Function & Memory API]. It provides native code access without the brittleness and danger of JNI. Previews in 19, 20 and 21.
** +link:https://openjdk.org/jeps/456[Unnamed Variables & Patterns] which allows you to write `_` when you don't need a variable. `catch (Exception _)`, `case RedBall _` etc. Underscore as a variable name has been a warning since 8 and an error since 9.
